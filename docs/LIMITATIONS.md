This document maps the surface on which Splunkology's published claims hold, and the surface beyond which they do not. It is companion to `THREAT_MODEL.md`: the threat model enumerates what could go wrong; this document enumerates where the system is not designed to be right. Every claim resolves to code merged at tag `v1.31.0-task16-threat-model` or earlier. Honesty is treated as an engineering property, not a disclaimer.

## 1. Scope

Splunkology v1.0 is an autonomous Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) agent built for a single analyst, on a single workstation, against forensic images already acquired offline. It runs five orchestration paradigms — Anthropic native loop, LangGraph, OpenAI function-calling, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude Code headless CLI — against one typed MCP server of forensic tools, and publishes per-paradigm F1 scores against two public datasets. Outside that envelope the system has not been validated, and outside that envelope the F1 numbers should not be cited.

What Splunkology *is*: a reproducible, single-tenant, offline-batch evaluation of how five LLM orchestration paradigms reason over the same forensic tool surface. What Splunkology *is not*: a deployed SOC product, a live-acquisition platform, a court-admissible chain-of-custody system, or a multi-analyst collaboration tool. The sections below decompose the gap between the two.

## 2. Evidence-Shape Limitations

The validation surface is two public datasets: TEST-001 (SRL-2018 APT memory image, 4 applicable IOCs) and TEST-002 (NIST CFReDS Hacking Case / Greg Schardt's SCHARDT NTFS disk image, 5 applicable IOCs). Beyond that surface the agent has been exercised but not measured.

- **Single-disk-image generalization gap.** Two of five orchestrators score F1 = 0.000 on TEST-002. ADR-006 §generalization-gap documents this as a tool-path-resolution gap, not a reasoning failure: the LangGraph and Claude Code adapters were preamble-configured for memory-image cases and invoked unavailable tools on disk evidence. Native Loop (0.600), OpenAI FC (0.800), and Gemini 3 Pro (0.400) returned non-zero F1 on the same image, which isolates the failure to orchestrator wiring rather than to model reasoning. The gap is real and the orchestrator-agnostic claim is bounded accordingly.
- **Memory-only IOC reach.** The current MCP tool catalog wraps Volatility 3 plugins — `windows.psscan`, `windows.netscan`, `windows.malfind`, `windows.mftscan.MFTScan`, `windows.mftscan.ADS`, `windows.registry.printkey`. IOCs that live exclusively in pcap streams, browser cache databases, encrypted containers, or cloud-resident logs are not within reach of this catalog. Their absence from a Splunkology verdict is not evidence of their absence from the case.
- **No live forensics.** Every published F1 is computed against a static image acquired before the agent ran. Splunkology has no acquisition capability of its own. Live memory capture from a running endpoint, live disk imaging, and volatile-artifact preservation are outside the system's design envelope.

---

## 3. Operational Limitations

The development and demonstration environment is a SIFT Workstation under UTM x86_64 emulation on an Apple M3 host. Several operational properties of the build follow from that fact and would change under different infrastructure.

- **UTM emulation cache bottleneck.** A 5 GB memory image under emulated x86_64 Volatility 3 times out without a file-based cache layer at `/cases/{case_id}/splunkology_cache/`. The cache is not an optimization; it is a precondition for the agent reaching its first tool call. On native x86 hardware this constraint does not apply, but no native-hardware F1 numbers are published.
- **No parallel case execution.** The audit DB is per-case at `/cases/{case_id}/{case_id}.db`. The `SnapshotWriter` holds an open connection for the lifetime of an investigation. Running two cases concurrently against the same workstation produces undefined behaviour in the dashboard's SSE event stream and is not supported.
- **Single-host MCP server.** The typed MCP server binds to localhost. Distributed forensics — multiple workstations attached to a single case — would require a different MCP transport layer that is not present in the current build.

---

## 4. Methodological Limitations

The benchmark is honest about what it measures. It is also honest about what F1 against a fixed manifest cannot tell you.

- **Text-match F1, not semantic F1.** The scorer compares emitted IOC literals against ground-truth literals via normalized string matching. Two semantically equivalent findings that differ in surface form (`172.16.4.10:8080` vs `172.16.4.10 on port 8080`) score differently. The scorer is a conservative measure of agreement, not a measure of analyst-grade equivalence.
- **n is small.** Two datasets, five orchestrators, single seed per cell. F1 deltas between orchestrators on a single dataset are descriptive of the runs that produced them and are not statistically defensible at standard significance thresholds. Larger n with multi-seed repeats is tracked under ADR-008 and remains post-hackathon work.
- **Ground truth is fixed and content-addressed.** Manifests are pinned at case open per ADR-007 §3.3. A finding that is correct in the world but absent from the manifest is a false positive in the scorer. The current manifests capture the IOCs the original case authors identified; they do not capture every defensible interpretation of the evidence.
- **No field-level IOC provenance yet.** Every IOC in a final report is traceable to a row in `iteration_snapshot.findings_so_far` per ADR-003 §3. It is not yet traceable to a specific byte range of a specific tool output. THREAT_MODEL §3.5 names this as the most important post-hackathon hardening step for evidentiary value in a real investigation, and it is the structural reason the system is not yet defensible as a sole authority on a verdict.

---

## 5. Deployment Limitations

Splunkology v1.0 is single-tenant and offline-batch. The deployment shape is intentional; the gaps it implies are not hidden.

- **Single-tenant by design.** No tenant isolation, no per-tenant audit DBs, no tenant-scoped MCP catalogs. A two-analyst shared-infrastructure deployment is out of scope.
- **Localhost MCP, no transport hardening.** The MCP server binds to `127.0.0.1`. There is no TLS, no client authentication beyond OS-level process boundaries, and no hosted REST front-end. THREAT_MODEL §5 marks "network-exposed API" as explicitly deferred.
- **No role-based access control (RBAC).** One analyst, one workstation, one audit trail. The DB is filesystem-readable to anyone with shell access to the host. RBAC is a prerequisite for any multi-tenant story and is tracked accordingly.
- **No SOC integration.** No SIEM push, no ticket-system hook, no PagerDuty / Slack / email egress. Verdicts terminate in a `final_report.md` and a row in `experiment_run`. Downstream consumption is manual by design and not a build target for v1.0.

## 6. When NOT to Use Splunkology

Each bullet below is an explicit do-not, not a hedge. If a use case matches one of these patterns, the right answer is a different tool.

- **Do not use Splunkology for live incident response where the evidentiary chain must hold in court.** Append-only discipline is enforced at the Python `SnapshotWriter` layer, not at the SQLite storage layer. THREAT_MODEL §3.4 documents that direct SQL against the DB file would succeed and that a row-chain hash is not yet implemented. For court-defensibility, that gap matters.
- **Do not use Splunkology for multi-analyst case collaboration.** There is no concurrent-write coordination, no role-based access, and no per-analyst attribution beyond a single `experiment_run.agent_id` field. Two analysts cannot meaningfully share a case.
- **Do not use Splunkology for cloud memory acquisition without a paired disk image, or for cases where evidence is not already acquired and at rest on the analyst workstation.** The cross-paradigm F1 result is published only against paired disk + memory evidence shapes already present under `/cases/{case_id}/`. The generalization claim does not extend to cloud-only or live-acquired inputs.
- **Do not use Splunkology as a real-time SOC alerting engine.** Wall-clock latency for a single case ranges from roughly 100 s (Native Loop, TEST-001) to roughly 260 s (Claude Code, TEST-002). The system is an offline-batch analyser, not a streaming-telemetry scorer.
- **Do not use Splunkology as the sole authority on a verdict.** The model can produce an IOC that incidentally matches ground truth (THREAT_MODEL §3.5). Treat its output as analyst-assistive, not analyst-replacing, until field-level provenance and a storage-layer audit moat are in place.

## 7. Roadmap

These limitations are not permanent; each has a sequenced resolution. The list below is a pointer to upstream sources, not a set of new promises.

- **Row-chain SHA-256 hash + SQLite triggers** rejecting UPDATE and DELETE on `iteration_snapshot`, `hypothesis_event`, and `blocked_mutation` (THREAT_MODEL §3.4, ADR-007 §6). Moves append-only enforcement from the Python interface down to the storage layer and closes the audit-tampering gap that today is mitigated only at the application boundary.
- **Field-level IOC provenance** linking every literal in a finding to a specific byte range of a specific tool output (THREAT_MODEL §3.5, ADR-007 §6). Distinguishes "found correctly" from "guessed correctly" and is the precondition for a court-defensibility story.
- **LangGraph and Claude Code disk-image tool preambles** to close the TEST-002 F1 = 0.000 gap documented in ADR-006 §generalization-gap. Mechanical work, tracked separately from architectural hardening.
- **Multi-tenant audit-DB layout and RBAC** (THREAT_MODEL §5, ADR-007 §6) as the prerequisite to any shared-infrastructure deployment narrative.
- **Multi-evaluator scoring and larger n with multi-seed repeats** (ADR-008) to convert descriptive F1 deltas into statistically defensible ones.

Each item above has an upstream document that names it, a code path that compiles today, and a labelled post-hackathon owner. None is a research project.
