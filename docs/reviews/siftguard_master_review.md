**Context:** SANS FIND EVIL Hackathon 2026  
**Status:** Deep Consolidated Risk Assessment & Refactoring Blueprint (Flash High Mode)

## Executive Summary

Splunkology is an autonomous Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) agent built to run on the SANS SIFT Workstation. The project stands out as a highly rigorous empirical submission, establishing a multi-orchestrator benchmark (Anthropic Native, LangGraph, OpenAI FC, Gemini Pro, Claude Code) over a single typed MCP server of forensic tools. It isolates orchestration as a single variable and maps a cost-accuracy Pareto frontier across two public forensics datasets (SRL-2018 memory and NIST CFReDS disk).

However, a deep, security-first architectural audit reveals critical gaps between the project's public narrative and its actual implementation. The "architectural evidence-integrity moat" is currently a logical abstraction rather than a hard security boundary, containing severe path-traversal loopholes, un-implemented database triggers, and massive process-level security risks. 

This master document compiles and deeply expands on all five reviews, providing a clear diagnostic analysis and immediate refactoring blueprints for the next engineering sprint.

## Review 1 — ADR Pushback (ADR-003, ADR-006, ADR-007)

This review pressure-tests the core claims, alternative designs, and logical inconsistencies within Splunkology's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

### 1. ADR-003: Agent Loop Instrumentation

* **Question 1 (Weakest Claim):** 
  * *Quote:* `"Raw INSERTs against iteration_snapshot or hypothesis_event are blocked at the application layer (the writer is the only module with INSERT access) and at the data layer (the append-only triggers would catch raw writes anyway)."` (Section 3.3)
  * *Pushback:* This claim exhibits a fundamental misunderstanding of database constraints. Triggers configured for `BEFORE UPDATE` and `BEFORE DELETE` do absolutely nothing to block raw `INSERT` queries. Any developer, buggy orchestrator, or prompt-injected agent executing raw SQL can bypass the application-layer `SnapshotWriter` and write malformed, duplicate, or out-of-order rows. The database layer does not enforce sequential iteration logic or schema-integrity validations on insert.
* **Question 2 (Architectural Alternative):** 
  * *Alternative:* An asynchronous, out-of-process structured event stream (e.g., writing telemetry events to a local Unix domain socket or named pipe consumed by an independent logging daemon).
  * *Tradeoff:* Decoupling the agent's execution from synchronous SQLite writes eliminates write-lock contention (`SQLITE_BUSY` errors) in the critical path of parallel or multi-threaded agent execution. The tradeoff is a small increase in deployment complexity and the potential for telemetry data loss if the daemon crashes, but it ensures telemetry collection never degrades core forensic tool performance.
* **Question 3 (Hostile Reviewer Question):** 
  * *Question:* *"Since SQLite locks the entire database file during a write transaction, how will this synchronous `SnapshotWriter` handle concurrent execution of multiple agents or parallel analysis threads without causing lock contention timeouts (`SQLITE_BUSY`) that block forensic tool execution?"*
* **Question 4 (Logical Inconsistency):** 
  * *Inconsistency:* ADR-003 mandates that the `SnapshotWriter` enforces a strict iteration schema and sequence. However, because ADR-007 implements strict `BEFORE UPDATE` and `BEFORE DELETE` abort triggers on all tables, the system cannot perform cleanups, retries, or rollbacks of partially written states in the event of an LLM call timeout or network failure mid-iteration. A failed iteration will leave a permanently corrupted, incomplete row that cannot be corrected, breaking the "comparable across orchestrators" guarantee.

### 2. ADR-006: Multi-Orchestrator Vendor Lock-In

* **Question 1 (Weakest Claim):** 
  * *Quote:* `"The orchestrator-agnostic claim holds for LLM reasoning quality. It is bounded by tool path resolution, which is an integration concern, not a paradigm concern."` (Section §generalization-gap)
  * *Pushback:* Dismissing a catastrophic F1 score of 0.000 for LangGraph and Claude Code on TEST-002 as a mere "tool path resolution/integration concern" is negligent. In an autonomous agent, dynamic context parameterization and tool interaction are core reasoning tasks. If the orchestration runtime cannot adapt its paths to the environment, the paradigm itself is broken for that environment, rendering the "orchestrator-agnostic" claim false.
* **Question 2 (Architectural Alternative):** 
  * *Alternative:* Standardizing on a single, production-grade, model-agnostic orchestration engine (like Temporal or a unified custom DAG runtime) and abstracting only the LLM interface via a standard gateway (e.g., LiteLLM).
  * *Tradeoff:* Reduces engineering overhead from maintaining five completely different runtime architectures (LangGraph, Messages loop, OpenAI FC, Gemini Loop, Claude Code CLI subprocess) to a single stable state machine. This eliminates runtime-specific bugs and prompt drift, at the cost of losing the ability to test alternative orchestration topologies.
* **Question 3 (Hostile Reviewer Question):** 
  * *Question:* *"Since Claude Code is a closed-source, interactive CLI binary designed for developer assistance, how can you guarantee its headless execution loop won't hang indefinitely waiting for user input, or bypass your logging entirely, if Anthropic pushes an unannounced upstream update?"*
* **Question 4 (Logical Inconsistency):** 
  * *Inconsistency:* ADR-006 C1 asserts that all five orchestrators are sandboxed and must access evidence through the typed MCP server to preserve the spoliation moat. However, `splunkology-claudecode` runs as a headless CLI subprocess that fundamentally requires direct terminal execution access to the SIFT workstation to run its own commands and spawn subprocesses. This direct terminal access permits the agent to execute arbitrary bash commands and write directly to the filesystem, completely neutralizing the MCP boundary and spoliation moat described in ADR-007.

### 3. ADR-007: Spoliation Moat

* **Question 1 (Weakest Claim):** 
  * *Quote:* `"Direct sqlite3 shell write to audit DB after agent run | Trigger ABORT at next read; case marked tainted"` (Section 4, Row 4)
  * *Pushback:* This is physically impossible for a local, serverless SQLite database. SQLite triggers only run when executing write operations *through* a connection that loads the schema. If an attacker or a rogue subprocess opens the `audit/<case_id>.db` file directly using the `sqlite3` CLI, they can modify, delete, or drop triggers and tables at will. The database cannot enforce triggers at "next read" nor can it detect out-of-band filesystem writes unless cryptographic row-signing is implemented, which is not in the schema.
* **Question 2 (Architectural Alternative):** 
  * *Alternative:* A cryptographically signed audit log (such as a forward-secure hash chain or a ledger system) combined with real-time out-of-band streaming to a remote syslog or SIEM endpoint.
  * *Tradeoff:* Replaces the easily bypassed local SQLite database with mathematical proof of tamper-resistance. This protects against filesystem-level deletions and modifications by compromised local processes, at the cost of introducing network dependencies and cryptographic key management overhead.
* **Question 3 (Hostile Reviewer Question):** 
  * *Question:* *"Since SQLite is a serverless database running in user space, what stops a compromised or jailbroken agent with filesystem write permissions from executing `PRAGMA writable_schema = ON;` to disable your triggers, or writing directly to the database file using standard file I/O to delete the audit trail?"*
* **Question 4 (Logical Inconsistency):** 
  * *Inconsistency:* ADR-007 claims that spoliation is made "mechanically impossible" by stripping the agent of write handles to evidence and forcing all writes into the audit DB. However, because the agent process must run under a user account with write permissions to the workspace directory to record audit logs, telemetry, and cache files, the OS-level boundaries are identical. An agent capable of writing to the audit database is operating-system-capable of writing to or deleting any file within its user privilege boundary, making the "architectural moat" a conceptual illusion rather than a physical security boundary.

## Review 2 — Code-Level Architecture Review

This review analyzes the abstractions inside `src/splunkology/orchestrators/`, `src/splunkology/mcp_server/`, and `src/splunkology/models/`.

### 1. Refactoring Target 1: Shotgun Parameterization in `BaseOrchestrator`
* **File and Function Name:** `src/splunkology/orchestrators/base.py` -> `BaseOrchestrator.run_case`
* **The Smell:** **Shotgun Parameterization.** The interface requires nine separate positional/keyword arguments just to invoke a case run, locking the core orchestration process into a fragile and non-extensible contract.
* **The Refactor:** Encapsulate all execution, runtime, telemetry, and debugging parameters into a single unified `InvestigationContext` or `CaseConfig` Pydantic model. This model will hold configurations for the case briefing, evidence file mappings, path locations, model names, ground truth parameters, and runtime flags. The protocol method signature will then be simplified to `async def run_case(self, context: InvestigationContext) -> tuple[str, str]`, ensuring that adding or modifying execution flags in future sprints only requires updating the data model rather than modifying the signature across the base class and all five adapter implementations.
* **Risk of Leaving As-Is:** **High.** Adding new features (such as token budget caps, model temperature overrides, caching controls, or runtime credentials) will trigger breaking signature changes across the entire multi-orchestrator pipeline, severely slowing down engineering velocity.

### 2. Refactoring Target 2: Hardcoded Schemas and Monolithic Tool Dispatch in `server.py`
* **File and Class/Function Name:** `src/splunkology/mcp_server/server.py` -> `TOOLS` static list and `DISPATCH` dictionary.
* **The Smell:** **Missing Abstraction / Shotgun Surgery.** The MCP server manually defines its entire tool catalog and JSON-Schema parameters inside a static list and uses a hardcoded dictionary mapping for tool execution.
* **The Refactor:** Implement a dynamic `Registry` abstraction using decorators to let forensic tools self-register their schemas, documentation, and executors directly from their implementation files (e.g., `@registry.tool(name="vol_pslist")`). At server startup, the registry will dynamically compile Pydantic models into the correct JSON-Schemas that the MCP framework requires. This decouples the transport layer (stdio stdio-server) from individual forensic tools (Volatility, RegRipper, TSK), keeping the codebase modular.
* **Risk of Leaving As-Is:** **Medium.** Adding, removing, or refactoring forensic tools requires changing code in three non-contiguous places (the imports, the static `TOOLS` list, and the `DISPATCH` dictionary), dramatically increasing schema-mismatch and integration bugs.

### 3. Refactoring Target 3: Three Disjoint Taxonomies for Telemetry Event Classification
* **File and Class/Function Name:** `src/splunkology/models/correction_taxonomy.py` -> `SelfCorrectionType` / `classify_correction`
* **The Smell:** **Leaky Abstraction & Inconsistent Domain Model.** The application manages three completely disjoint, overlapping taxonomies for the same event category: `SelfCorrectionType` in `models` (e.g., `FORMAT_RETRY`), the LLM-prompted output schema in `v2.txt` (`tool_failure_recovery`, `hypothesis_revision`), and the SQL database triggers (`promote`, `demote`, `replace`, `abandon`).
* **The Refactor:** Consolidate these three distinct representations into a single strongly-typed `InvestigationEvent` domain model that defines clear conversion, validation, and serialization rules. Prompt parsers, SQLite database insert hooks, and dashboard telemetry analytics will then consume this unified class as the single source of truth, replacing the brittle substring keyword matching (`classify_correction`) currently used to render the self-correction taxonomy on the dashboard.
* **Risk of Leaving As-Is:** **Medium.** Telemetry visualizations and evaluation benchmarks will suffer from data quality drift, resulting in inaccurate self-correction tracking and fragile parsing errors whenever the model output deviates slightly from the keyword-heuristic lists.

### 4. The Single Biggest Architectural Risk in the Orchestrator-to-MCP Boundary
The single biggest architectural risk is the **complete lack of OS-level process and privilege isolation between the Orchestrators and the MCP Server.**

Because Splunkology runs as a local application on the SIFT Workstation under the same user privileges (e.g., `sansforensics`), **the MCP boundary is a logical interface, not a security boundary.** 

If a malicious prompt injection or model jailbreak occurs—especially when running interactive or shell-executing adapters like `splunkology-claudecode`—the LLM is not restricted to calling the "read-only" MCP tool catalog. Because the orchestrator and the MCP server share the same process environment and write-permissions to the evidence directories, a compromised agent can execute standard Python or Bash commands to:
1. Modify or delete the raw evidence images directly.
2. Disable, drop, or rewrite the SQLite database file and its triggers.
3. Tamper with the committed ground truth or local cache files.

A true "spoliation moat" requires **hard security boundaries** at the operating system level: the orchestrator must execute in an isolated, zero-privilege container or non-privileged user sandbox with zero direct filesystem write-access to `/cases/` or the case database, leaving the independent, privileged MCP server process as the *only* component authorized to execute reads on the evidence files and write-appends to the case SQLite database.

## Review 3 — Test Gap Scan (Codex)

This review identifies the three highest-risk untested or under-tested code paths in `src/splunkology/` and defines specific test cases to remediate them.

### 1. Gap 1: Relative Path-Traversal Vulnerability in `safe_exec` Path Validation
* **File and Class/Function:** `src/splunkology/mcp_server/safe_exec.py` -> `safe_exec` function
* **Why it is High-Risk:** **Security Boundary & Evidence Integrity.** The function prevents directory escape only if the path argument literally starts with `/` or `./`. An attacker or a jailbroken model can bypass this check completely by passing a relative path starting with `..` (e.g., `../../etc/passwd` or `../../cases/TEST-002/secrets.txt`), exposing files outside the evidence directory.
* **Specific Test Case to Add:**
  * *Scenario:* Mock a call to `safe_exec` using an allowed binary (e.g., `fls`) and pass arguments containing relative path traversals that do not start with a slash or dot-slash, such as `["-r", "cases/../secrets.txt"]` or `["../../etc/passwd"]`.
  * *Assertion:* Assert that a `SafeExecError` is raised with a message matching `path escapes evidence root`.
  * *What it would catch:* This test would fail under the current code structure, immediately exposing a major path-traversal vulnerability that allows models to access raw workstation system files.

### 2. Gap 2: SQLite Database Append-Only Enforcement at the Storage Layer
* **File and Class/Function:** `src/splunkology/audit/log.py` (or the migration setup verifying table triggers)
* **Why it is High-Risk:** **Evidence Integrity & Chain of Custody.** Splunkology’s ADR-007 claims that the audit database is protected from post-hoc tampering by database-level triggers (`BEFORE UPDATE` and `BEFORE DELETE` triggers raising `ABORT`). However, `README.md` and `THREAT_MODEL.md` both disclose that this is a known gap and that the triggers are not implemented at the database layer.
* **Specific Test Case to Add:**
  * *Scenario:* Open a direct SQLite connection to the case database (e.g., `audit/TEST-001.db`) using the standard library `sqlite3` driver—bypassing the application's `SnapshotWriter` class—and attempt to execute an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` query (e.g., `DELETE FROM hypothesis_event` or `UPDATE iteration_snapshot SET cost_usd = 0.0`).
  * *Assertion:* Assert that the SQLite engine aborts the write transaction and raises a `sqlite3.OperationalError` with the message `'append-only'`.
  * *What it would catch:* Under the current repository status, this test would pass (i.e., allow the deletion/modification to succeed), exposing that the system's "tamper-proof" evidence claim is an application-level convention rather than a hard database-level constraint.

### 3. Gap 3: Timeout Recovery & Connection Cleanup in the Orchestrator Loops
* **File and Class/Function:** `src/splunkology/agent/loop_v2.py` (or `splunkology/agent/loop.py`) -> Loop execution functions
* **Why it is High-Risk:** **Orchestrator Failure Modes & Database Concurrency.** If an LLM call or a Volatility subprocess hangs or times out, the orchestrator must terminate gracefully. If it crashes without writing a final state or closing its database connection, it leaves open transaction locks, corrupting subsequent benchmark runs.
* **Specific Test Case to Add:**
  * *Scenario:* Initialize an agent loop and mock the HTTP/API client (`google-genai` or `anthropic` client) to raise a `TimeoutError` or mock an MCP tool dispatch to hang indefinitely during the second loop iteration.
  * *Assertion:* Assert that the loop terminates gracefully, writes a final row to the database with `terminated_reason = "error"`, records the elapsed duration, and cleanly closes the `SnapshotWriter` connection.
  * *What it would catch:* It would identify cases where a timeout triggers an unhandled traceback that crashes the script mid-execution, leaving the database file locked in a dirty state and preventing the dashboard from loading subsequent cases.

## Review 4 — System-Level Architecture Risk (Gemini)

This review evaluates the system's production-readiness, primary competitive differentiators, winning risk factors, and guardrail structures.

### 1. Steve Anson's Strongest Objection (Valhuntir Author)
* **The Objection:** Splunkology lacks physical scaling capability, exhibits fragile environment dependency, and is structurally bottlenecked by Volatility timeouts under emulation, requiring static file caches to run at all on small 5GB test images.
* **Specifics:** In a real-world enterprise incident, memory images are 16GB–64GB and disk images are hundreds of gigabytes or terabytes. A system whose loop soft-timeouts at 120 seconds on a 5GB file is fundamentally unusable in the field. Additionally, because the database connection is held open by `SnapshotWriter` for the entire run, Splunkology cannot run concurrent cases without causing database lockups and corrupting its dashboard SSE stream, making it a single-analyst, offline batch toy rather than a SOC-ready parallel analysis engine.

### 2. Primary Competitive Differentiator
* **The Differentiator:** Splunkology's rigorous, multi-orchestrator empirical benchmarking harness, which isolates orchestration as a single variable across five paradigms while keeping models, prompts, and tools fixed.
* **Specifics:** While competing submissions rely on narrative handwaving ("our agent is 90% accurate") or evaluate a single model loop on a single test case, Splunkology implements **five interchangeable orchestration paradigms** over the *identical* typed MCP server. It is the only project that isolates orchestration as a single variable to mathematically define a **cost-accuracy Pareto frontier** ($0.1949 vs $0.5293 per run) and expose paradigm-specific behavioral dynamics.

### 3. Biggest Win Risk Factor (Outside Control)
* **The Risk:** Upstream API stability and deprecation cycles across multiple vendor SDKs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, LangGraph, Claude Code).
* **Specifics:** If Anthropic or OpenAI introduces a breaking change to their function-calling APIs, alters model prompt-tracking schemas, or deprecates a model identifier (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-6` or `gpt-5.5`) in their live endpoints, the adapters will crash. Any upstream latency spike or rate-limiting will trigger a cascading series of per-iteration timeouts in Splunkology’s loop, completely breaking reproducibility during live evaluation.

### 4. Architectural vs. Prompt Guardrails
* **The Verdict:** **The claim is not fully defensible.** Splunkology is highly vulnerable, and the "architectural" enforcement has massive, systemic gaps that make it partially prompt-dependent or easily bypassed:
  1. **SQLite Triggers are Absent:** ADR-007 claims database-level triggers block updates/deletes. Triggers are completely absent from the actual SQLite schema, meaning any shell process or injected agent can execute direct SQL writes or file-level deletes/modifications.
  2. **Insecure Path Traversal Validation:** `safe_exec.py` only validates paths starting with `/` or `./`. Passing a relative path like `../../etc/passwd` completely bypasses the validation loop, allowing full path traversal.
  3. **Claude Code Shell Access:** Headless Claude Code CLI execution requires direct terminal execution rights on the Ssans SIFT workstation host, allowing a jailbroken model to bypass the MCP server wrappers and execute arbitrary shell commands.
  4. **Prompt-Based Calibration & Reasoning:** The confidence calibration rules and self-correction classifications are governed entirely by soft prompt instructions in `v2.txt`. Prompt drift or jailbreaks can easily corrupt dashboard metrics and the F1 scorer.

---

## Review 5 — Devpost Narrative Pressure-Test (Codex)

This review pressure-tests the Devpost submission narrative (`SUBMISSION.md`) and Loom script (`loom_script.md`) to expose gaps before a judge does.

### 1. Unbacked or Inaccurate Narrative Claims

* **Unbacked Claim 1: Database-Level Trigger Enforcement**
  * *Narrative Quote:* `"Append-only audit DB. SQLite with insert-only access enforced at the data layer. Migrations versioned and verified at startup."` (`SUBMISSION.md`, line 73)
  * *The Reality:* The database does *not* actually enforce append-only triggers or database-level constraints. Enforcement is done entirely by the Python `SnapshotWriter` class.
* **Unbacked Claim 2: Complete Architectural Spoliation Moat**
  * *Narrative Quote:* `"Spoliation test suite: 12/12 attacks blocked architecturally at the MCP layer — not by prompt"` (`SUBMISSION.md`, line 92)
  * *The Reality:* The validation logic in `safe_exec.py` contains a severe vulnerability where relative paths starting with `..` skip the check entirely, permitting path-traversal escapes. The architecture does *not* block relative path traversal.
* **Unbacked Claim 3: Zero Hallucinated Findings Proof**
  * *Narrative Quote:* `"Zero hallucinated findings — every claim traces to a tool-execution row in the append-only audit DB."` (`SUBMISSION.md`, line 238)
  * *The Reality:* Splunkology does *not* actually enforce field-level provenance linking finding literals to raw tool response bytes. The agent can still hallucinate an IP or process name that coincidentally matches the ground truth.

### 2. Marketing to Engineering Reframes

* **Reframe 1 (Adversary Gap):** 
  * *Marketing:* `"The gap is real: adversaries move at machine speed. Defenders don't. Splunkology closes that gap."` (`SUBMISSION.md`, line 37)
  * *Engineering Reframe:* *"Splunkology automates the correlation, sequencing, and analysis of memory and disk forensics on a SIFT Workstation, reducing triage latency from hours of manual CLI analysis to a 100-260s automated pipeline."*
* **Reframe 2 (Sigstore Court-Defensibility):** 
  * *Marketing:* `"Court-defensible by design — SBOM signed with Sigstore keyless; SLSA Level 3 build provenance"` (`SUBMISSION.md`, line 96)
  * *Engineering Reframe:* *"Ensures supply-chain integrity for the deployment VM image using Sigstore keyless signatures and SLSA Level 3 build verification, ensuring the virtual machine package is tamper-evident."*
* **Reframe 3 (Wall vs. Prompt):** 
  * *Marketing:* `"The system prompt is defense-in-depth. The architecture is the wall."` (`loom_script.md`, line 69)
  * *Engineering Reframe:* *"The custom MCP server acts as an isolation boundary by exposing only a fixed, version-pinned read-only API of approved forensic tools, moving safety enforcement from soft prompt instructions to hard typed execution wrappers."*

### 3. Loom Script Gaps vs. Live Demo Reality

* **Multi-Orchestrator Comparison:** Frame 2 states, `"Select Native Loop. Dashboard re-binds to that adapter's cached run."` This reveals to the judge that the dashboard is not running the orchestrators *live* during the demo, but is instead loading pre-computed cache files. If a judge requests a live comparison, they will witness the substantial latency (100–260s wall clock time) and potential Volatility timeouts.
* **The Unverified Spoliation Test:** Frame 4 shows running `pytest tests/spoliation/test_spoliation.py` to prove the spoliation moat. However, a technical judge reviewing the test file will see that it only validates a hardcoded list of command strings (like `"/etc/passwd"`). The test suite fails to test relative path escapes (`../../etc/passwd`), concealing the path-traversal vulnerability in the MCP server's safe executor.
* **Brittle Telemetry Classification:** The "Self-Correction Taxonomy" shown in the dashboard is not mapped to structured database entities; it relies on keyword substring heuristics (`classify_correction`). Any slight variation in the model's explanation format will break the dashboard's rendering, which is not apparent in the Loom script's polished sequence.
